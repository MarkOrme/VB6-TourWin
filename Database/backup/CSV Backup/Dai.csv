Then I got stuck behind a  crash. Stopped completely and put my foot down. Rode hard to catch backup. Mainly drafing of others as they came by. Then got caught behind another crash on a single lane bridge. This all happen before the turn around. On the way back lost contact with the lead pack going up a steep climb. Took me a while to recover. When I did I rode very well with a four other cyclists. Then about 12 Km from the finish, I flated. Finished the race with a flat tyre. Oh well.

============
Followed the 1 week cycling, resting Tuesday and Wednesday with a light ride on Thursday. On Friday, I rode for about 1 1/2 hours, doing one UBC interval. 
Saturday's race was 20 laps or 120 KM. Very windy. I did a good job of staying near the front and even put in some jumps to catch people ahead of me. With three laps to go, the lack of water was getting to me. I cut off to get some water from my car, but it was not enough.
